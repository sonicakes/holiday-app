# Holiday App

## Objectives

- To pull everything together by building a web application from the ground up.
- To demonstrate mastery of topics  like Ruby, Rails, MVC, etc.
- Work individually for this project.

## Core Requirements
Make sure to do all of the following with your app.

### Models
 Your app should have at least 3 models. Make sure they are associated correctly!

### Views
 Use partials to DRY (Donâ€™t Repeat Yourself) up your views.
### Handles invalid data.
 Forms in your application should validate data and handle incorrect inputs. Validate sign up information, verify valid email addresses and secure passwords.
###Use Gems
 Use a GEM that talks to an API to add functionality to your app.
### User Login.
 Make sure you have basic authentication and authorization set up (if you need it).
### Heroku.
 Deploy your code to Heroku.
## Challenge Add-Ons

- Front-end Framework. Use either Twitter Bootstrap or Foundation to kick start your front-end.

- File upload. Take a look at Cloudinary.

- Web Scraping. Check out Nokogiri.

## Planning and Deliverables

- **Scope**. What are you planning to build? What features will it have? What do you reasonably think you can implement in the time period?

- **Object Models**. Draw out the model associations for your project.

- **Wireframes**. Sketch out what a few of your core pages will look like and how they will work. Paper works great. You can also check out wireframing software like Gliffy or Omnigraffle.

- **Milestones**. Outline some milestones for yourself based on how you prefer to work.

- **Readme.md** Projects need a readme file in markdown explaining their project: a how and why of what you wanted to solve, how you built, problems, tech used.

### Completed Project deliverables:
- Link to Heroku hosted project

- Link to source code on GitHub
